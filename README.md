## Is there an issue?

Create a new thread [here](https://github.com/huggiewuggies/nothuggiewuggies/issues) and explain the issue clearly. No formats needed to follow, just explain the issue and why is it happening. (if not possible then I'll try to find where the issue occurs)

I will also be in the support server if there is a problem searching for my account.
